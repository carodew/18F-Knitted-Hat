![two knitted hats, one with bright blue and navy 18F and one with inverse colors of the first](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10144074/15235574/8b4075c0-188a-11e6-9bf2-01f484e7513b.jpg)

## Yarn

1 skein (100 grams / 128 yards) Cascade 128 Superwash in Turquoise (812)
1 skein (100 grams / 128 yards) Cascade 128 Superwash in Navy (854)

You could also use black and white yarn and still be on brand, or use eitherblack or white yarn with the turquoise.

## 1. Make the hat

[Download this base pattern for the hat](https://www.jimmybeanswool.com/images/freePatterns/STMTNGrandTargheeHat.pdf) (It's a free PDF from Jimmy Beans Wool) 

Follow instructions for knitting the hat except don't change colors for the stripes. Instead, after making the ribbed section, knit in stockinette until the hat measures about 8" from the edge, then follow instructions for finishing the hat. 

## 2. Add the logo

After you have a hat, get your contrast color and use a darning needle to add the logo using the [duplicate stitch](http://www.purlsoho.com/create/2007/10/28/duplicate-stitch/) technique. Leave two rows of stockinette between the ribbing and the bottom edge of the logo.

Weave in all ends. 

## 3. Be the envy of your coworkers

Place hat on head. Continue in this manner until coworkers burst into green flames of envy.
